## Intro 


- The *c programming language* needs a **compiler** before the code can run.
	- The compiler *builds*, or compiles, your code into computer-readable code.  


*  -- Naming convention is **camelCase** -- 

You run it through compiler with the `make` keyword :
```bash
make hello.c
```


## The main() function

Every program must include a `main()` function.
