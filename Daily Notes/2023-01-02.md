## Daily Events or Thoughts

- Well it is the new year. I'm still in Vegas - didn't really do anything for New Years. Just stayed inside with mom and dad and worked. I was ok with it, for the most part. Sometimes I think stuff like that just makes me feel lonely. Like I don't have any friends. BUT I know that it is something I want to work on.
- For 2023, I want to work on being more confident, and social again #goal-2023
