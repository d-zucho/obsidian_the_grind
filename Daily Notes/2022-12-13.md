## Daily Events or Thoughts


03:45 PM
- Just talked to Shaulov, and he agreed to give me more Suboxone for the next month. Thank god because I only have a few left.

- So apparently, Trevor did not hookup with what his face on his sleep over date. But he still won't completely admit to me that it was a date. Even though he did to his mom. This is what makes it hard and confusing. Why won't he just tell me? Is it just not to hurt my feelings? Or something else? Or, am I reading too much into it. Ugh, here I go again ha. 
- And of course, last night when I find out he didn't do anything, I was cuddling with him on the couch. Well not at first. And when he noticed I was being distant, he was more cuddling and telling me he wanted me to be close. Why can't he just be like that... all the time. Who knows. Ok... back to work.
