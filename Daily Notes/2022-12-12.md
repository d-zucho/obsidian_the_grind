## Daily Events or Thoughts

12:33 PM
- Well [[Trevor]] is still no thome from his date last night. What a nice thought. 
- But I hung out with [[Kennedy]] yesterday and we were talking about me and Trevor, and him and his current boy situation. He told me things I know... or at least should already know --
	- I have more important things to worry about than [[Trevor]]; things that need more attention in my life right now: 
		- I need to start making money... and **soon**.
		- Start school again -- and figure out in what direction in school I want to go. 
		- What I am going to do about living situations - Orange County or Vegas with the parents. 
		- And so much more
