- Blooms' Taxonomy is a systematic way of describing how a learner's performance develops from simple to complex levels in their affective, psychomotor and cognitive domain of learning. In their cognitive domain, there are six stages, namely: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis and Evaluation. Traditional education tends to base the student learning in this domain.
