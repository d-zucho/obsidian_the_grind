## V-NAND Vs 3D NAND – What’s The Difference?

## All The Different Names

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">NAND & 3D NAND</mark>

- These are **the same thing**: *V-NAND* #ssd/v-nand
	- Created by Samsung in 2013 -- when they first managed to get 3D NAND cells working on devices


 This whole technology advanced SSDs in general since **stacking the cells in a vertical way enabled lower prices for all parties envolved.**
 - It allowed even the cheapest of SSDs to be up to 2 TB (a first)


## Modern SSDs - They Are Vertically Stacked

Since [[3D-NAND]] is so efficient, all manufacturers use vertical stacking for SSDs.

* Vertically stacked cells *increase size* of the storage

**The difference** to pay attention to is actually their #ssd/nand  cell type. 

> Some cell types are more efficient at read/write tasks than others, which also makes them more expensive.


```ad-important
title: Key Point
What actually affects drive's performance is how many bits per NAND cell there are.

The **more** bits per NAND cell, the more the performance and reliability worsens

```




### Summary

- Though they have different names, both terms refer to the same thing: **vertically stacking of cells** which gives ability to increase size of drive and lower the price.
	- With lower prices, it made it more available to avg consumer
