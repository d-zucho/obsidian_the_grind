# Lecture 1 - Part 2

## Heavy Interst in Tech During WWII

### Antanasoff-Berry Computer
- John Atanasoff & Cliff Berry
- *ABC Computer* - can be thoght of as 1st digital electronic computer
	- Developed in 1939 in Iowa State University
	- **Designed to solve linear equations** -- Special Purpose Computer
	- Semi-electric
	- 300 Vaccum Tubes
## Utilized many new technologies
- First machine to store data as a charge on a capacitor, which is how copmuters store info in their main memory today
- Used *binary system of arithmetic*
- Parallel processing
- regenerative memory
	- separation of memory and computing functions
- Influenced the ENIAC

# [[Alan Turing]] #person #cs 
![[Alan Turing]]

- *1943* - Thos Flowers & Max Newman - Developed *Colossus*
	- This broke the *Lorenz SC (TUNNY) code*
	- Used many of Turings Theories
	- Was the **first fully functioning digital electronic computer**
	- Not turing complete (special purpose)
	- No internally stored programs
	- 15-1600 vacuum tubes

- *1945* [[Alan Turing]] Designed the first ==Turing-Complete== Machine - **Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)**
	- By 1948, Turing left project due to organizational issues
	- **Electronically stored programs**
- Turing was key in development in cryptography, AI, and computational Biography

# Mauchy & Ekert

- *ENIAC* (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator)
- • 1946 - Developed for the Military
- First Turing Complete Computer Built
- **Based on Atanasoff's Work** but gave no credit
- Calculated Firing Tables
- a 17,468 vacuum tubes
- 70,000 resistors - 10,000 capacitors
- 1,500 relays • 6,000 manual switches
- 1800 square feet of floor space => weighed 30 tons


## UNIVAC (UNIVersal Automatic Computer)

- 1951 - Developed for the census bureau
- 1952 - successfully predicted outcome of the Eisenhower-Stevenson election
- **Used magnetic tape**
