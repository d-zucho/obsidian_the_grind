# Type Conversion / Coercion

Often we way need to change a type of a value, for example, from a string into a number to do math.

For this, we use **type conversion** - changing a value from on type into another #keywords #js/keywords 


```ad-note

Because JS is weakly-typed, at-time type conversions are done automatically. Because of this, there are two types of type conversion:
>- **Implicit type conversion**
>- **Explicity type conversion**


```

## Implicit Type Conversion / Type Coercion

- Implicity conversion - happens automatically #keywords #js/keywords 

```ad-info
title: Key Point
When conversion happens automatically, it is called **coercion**
```

- Usually happens when apply operators to two different types

## Explicity Type Conversion

- Explicity conversion occurs when we manually change the type of one value to another #keywords #js/keywords 


```ad-info
title: Key Point
Explicit type conversion can be done into three types:
 - to string
 - to boolean
 - to number
```
