# Mutated Values

Variable mutation is simply *reassigning* a variable to another value. 
- This can just be done using the assignment operator ('=')
```javascript
var a = 5
var a = 20
```


 When we do this, we **mutate** our variable


# Copy Values

We can use *values* through *variables* and assign them to other *variables*.

We do this by assigning a variable to the other variable directly.
