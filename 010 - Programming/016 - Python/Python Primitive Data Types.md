## String

Line of characters
- index starts at 0

### Getting Character by Index

Use **bracket notation** after string (or variable of string)
```ad-example
```
```python
"hello"[4]
> 'o'
```

## Integer

All whole numbers, *positive AND negative* are integers.


For better readability, when we have large numbers that are usually seperated by commas in 'regular english', we can use _ instead.

```python
# 123,433
# is same as
123_433
```


## Floats and Booleans 
Like all the others
