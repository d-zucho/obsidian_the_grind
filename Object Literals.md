# Object - Literaks


- Objects are a kind of data type that is made up of properties (or *key-value pairs* ).
- Values are not accessible through an index because it is *not ordered*, instead though their *keys*

>[!example]
>```javascript
>const myObject = {
>	name: 'Danny',
>	age: 21,
>}

To access the `name` property, you would use:
```javascript
myObject.name
//  'Danny'
```

OR

```javascript
myObject['name']
```
