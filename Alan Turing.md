Contributed to many fields

- Worked at Bletchley Park
	- Set up during WWII, with sole purpose of decrypting german code
- *1936 - Invented Universal Turing Machine*
	- Described Stored programs and self-modifying code (related to AI)
	- **Turing Complete** - is when a machine can perform anything that is calculatable #keyterm #cs/keyterm
	- Envisioned general purpose machines instead of just special purpose

- *1936* - Developed the Bombe - Turing (electro-machanical)
	- Broke the German **Enigma** code
	- Estimated to have ended WWII 2 years early - others argue the British would have lost...

- *1945* [[Alan Turing]] Designed the first ==Turing-Complete== Machine - **Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)**
	- By 1948, Turing left project due to organizational issues
	- **Electronically stored programs**
- Turing was key in development in cryptography, AI, and computational Biography

Was burglarized, but police focused on him being gay
Was arrested and made to go through chemical castration which led to his suicide

England only apologized 50 years later (maybe after finding out that he helped people)
**Would they have apologized if they didnt find out??** #follow-up
