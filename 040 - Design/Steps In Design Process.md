## Planning Phase

```ad-important

- Could be considered the most important

- Where we decide most important steps/concepts and map out the entire product
```


- How should it look?
- How Should it feel?
- What should it do?

- Lots of interaction with client to see:
	- what are their goals?
	- what are their users' goals


- You and client should come up with *common defined goals* so you know what to achieve.
