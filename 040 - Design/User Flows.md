 ## What are User Flows?

> [!`NOTE`] A.K.A.
> UI Flows

- Series of steps illustrated to show what users will go through to achieve a meaningful goal.
	- Checkout
	- Add something to cart
	- Search for product, 
	- etc. 
- 
**Example:**

- User flows work best when we want to convey a *distinct interaction*
	- They tell a story and are much easier for people to remember and define from the images


```ad-attention
title: Most Important Detail

They outline the goal the user achienves by completing the flow
```

### What Should Be Included
- Name
- Steps
- Users
- Description of what happens at each step


## Steps

1. **Give it a name that describes its purpose**

2. **Make sure user flow / UI flow, only goes in one direction**

3. **They represent a complete task**
	- Scope of each flow, should demonstrate a single task / goal without many different endings.
		- If too short, they fail to tell a story, 
		- If too long, they loose their meaning
