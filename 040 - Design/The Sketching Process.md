## Sketching Process

1. **Be Prepared!**
	- Always hace all the tooks you need
	- Know the goals / the answers you are trying to get
	- Who is your audience?
	- Always 'timebox yourself'


2. **Just Start and Do It**
	- Just draw a frame for whatever device you are designing for and start drawing
	- Start with more simple and redundanty elements
	- Then move into the more detailed interactions -- however, *still only need 2 or 3 shapes to accomplish everything*
	- **Annotate** your sketches and keep them safe

		- Point on reasoning and explain interactions

	- Use numbers to show the flow of your sketches
	- Use arrows to show any transitions
	- Try to think about some gestures that you could add.
