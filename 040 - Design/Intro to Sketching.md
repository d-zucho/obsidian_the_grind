# Intro to Sketching


## Sketching is a 2 Step Process


1. Idea Formation
		-Want to generate as many ideas/approaches  as we can -- brain dump -- and decide which is best for the task at hand

2. Add Detail & Refinement



## From Idea to Refinement


### Ideas

- When first doing your brain dump, or idea generation, the sketches should:
	- be very low detail

### Wireframes
- Then we can take some of the ideas we like, and add some extra detail to make them into wireframes.

	- Here, we add more detail based on ideas ; whether it be buttons, some layout features. But doesnt need to have all detail

### Components

 - As we are going through the wireframes, start to think more about visual design and try to keep in mind the elements that are really important / needed.
	 - These can be buttons, inputs, sections of content, etc.
