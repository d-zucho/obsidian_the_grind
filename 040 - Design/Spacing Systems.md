## How to Apply Spacial Systems



### Element first (strict element sizing)

- In this approach, the *sizing of solid elements takes priority when matched to your predetermined spatial system*. 
	- This includes things like buttons and form inputs. 
	- These elements are more likely to have predictable content and are key to creating rhythm in the overall composition.

### Content first (strict internal padding)

- *When the content is less predictable and we care about its display, we will want to enforce strict internal padding and allow element sizes to be dictated by their content.* 
- These element’s sizes may still fall into your spatial system’s rules but that is secondary to the spacing around the content. 
- This is useful for tables with indeterminate user content.
