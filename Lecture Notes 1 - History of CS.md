- Why was it important for past people to invest what they did in tech


- Who were the key people/players in "my field"
	- To be able to articulate some point in the future that could help me explain and articulate some project or reason behind something. 

- When was first computer (programmabe, cpu, and memory) ?


## Early Computing Tools

- Motivation for computing tools -- looking for accurate and more efficient ways in computing things / calculation tools
- Used to be a *job description*
	- **people** were computers - well into 1940s

- Initially came from the need to:
	- track planets
	- navigation
	- agriculture (seasons)
	- later on -- military and political purposes
	- Then, and now, it is also driven by monetary gain


# The Beginning

- ## Early computing tools -- 
	- about 2400 BC => Abacus (Babylonia - present day Iraq)
		- 5 lower rings represented fingers
		- 2 upper rings represented hands

- 100 BC => *Antikythera Mechanism (Greek)*
	- **Earliest known Mechanical Analog Computer**
	- Discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck
	- Salt encrusted metal gears and pointers
	- More than 30 gears - very complex arrangement - *emulated the planetary revolutions*
	- Very likely to be used for ==ship navigational purposes==

## 17th Century

- 1610 => Logarith for Computing
	- John Napier 
	- Came up with Napier's Rods ( or Napiers Bones)
		- Rods that could be moved around and placed in specially constructed boards.
		- ![[Pasted image 20230123221140.png]]
		- *Simplified multiplacation to the act of addition*
	- ![[Pasted image 20230123221845.png]]

- 1622 - William Oughtred => Germany
	- Slide rule based on John Napier's workl
	- Could calculate multiplication, division, roots, exponents, square
	- Used well into the 20th centure
		- Replaced by Calculators in the 1970s
	- This device by William even got us to the moon
- **overflow** number trying to store has exceeded number of digits that can be stored in that place

- 1623 - Willhelm Shickard
	- (*Calculating Clock*)
	- First **discrete automatic calculator**
	- Could add/subtract up to 6-digit numbers
		- Bell warned of overflow
	- Constructed with wheels
	- Used by Johannes Kepler for astronomical studies
	- Began the "Computer Era"
	- Used in modern day odometers
- 1624 - "Pascaline" - mechanical adding machine
