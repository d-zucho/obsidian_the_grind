# CSS Tricks

## Background-image and Blend mode


We can have both an image as a background and mix in a color. Almost have effects like those in *photoshop*
Do  this with the following:

```css

body {
	background-image: url(photo.jpg);
	background-color: #00ce2d;
	background-blend-mode: screen;  /* or darken, lighten, or etc.*/
}
```



## Clipping

The html:
```html
div.
```
