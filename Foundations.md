## JavaScript Engine
#javascript/js-engine 

The JS Engine helps JS write code that is asynchronous

### How it works

It takes the JS code and parses it into *tokens* analyzes what it is trying to do. #javascript/js-engine  

These tokens are then formed into ***ASTs***,  abstract syntax tree. #javascript/js-engine 

The interpreter, profiler, and compiler then work to turn the code into optimized code for the cpu


You can run JavaScript with **the interpreter** or the **compiler**


#### Why choose one over the other?
