# Web Hosting


Web hosting - service where we place our website and files on companies servers without needing your own equipment.

## 4 Types of Web Hosting

#### Shared Hosting

- Often the least expensive
- You pay for "renting" real estate on a server that shares all resources with X amount of others on the same server which can slow your performance
	- Processing power
	- Memory
	- Bandwidth



#### Virtual Private Hosting

- A virtual server with dedicated resources
- It will be running on a hardware server with other VPS, but because each has its own allocated resource and computing power, others will not likely slow you down.


#### Dedicated Hosting

- A harware server that is dedicated only to you
- All resources (cpu, memory, bandwidth, etc)


#### Cloud Hosting
