    -   A network is formed when two or more computers connect wirelessly or via wire and communicate with each other


- A network can become very cluttered since each computer needs to connect to every device in that network. Because of this, a **network switch** is used.


A network switch is a device that connects others devices in a network and allows them to "talk to each other".
