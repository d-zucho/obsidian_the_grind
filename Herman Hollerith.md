- Need for acocunting in the 1980s census
	- 1880-1889 there was a 10% population growth
	- census bureu stressed b/c they knew they couldnt do the census in the 10 years from the methods they had used in the past

	- How many electorials we get is defined by the census

- **Herman Hollerith won this** with the Holleriths desk
